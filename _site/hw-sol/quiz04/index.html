    <p><strong>Solutions:</strong> You can find the file with
solutions for all questions <a href="quiz04.sql">here</a>.</p>

<p>Quiz submissions were graded automatically for correctness.
Implementations <strong>did not</strong> need to be efficient, as long
as they were correct.</p>

<p>In addition to the doctests provided to students, we also used
extra doctests to check for corner cases. These extra test cases are
highlighted below.</p>

<h3 id="sql">SQL</h3>


<p>To complete this quiz, you will need to use Sqlite version 3.8.3 or greater.
See <a href="http://cs61a.org/lab/lab12">Lab 12</a> for setup and usage instructions.</p>

<p>To check your progress, you can run <code>sqlite3</code> directly by running:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite3 -init quiz04.sql</code></pre>

<p>You should also check your work using <code>ok</code>:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok</code></pre>

<p>If OK is not able to use <code>sqlite3</code> to verify your work directly, it
will at least show you the output of the test cases, like the
following:</p>

<pre><code>size &gt; Suite 1 &gt; Case 1

Unfortunately, OK is unable to use sqlite3 to test your code directly.
Here is a transcript of what your code does in the sqlite3 interpreter.

TEST:
    .read quiz04.sql
    select * from open_locations where n &gt;= 5;
EXPECTED (order does not matter):
    5
    7
    9
    10
OUTPUT:
    5
    7
    9
    10

Please manually check if your solution's output is correct.</code></pre>

<p>As long as the displayed <code>OUTPUT</code> matches the <code>EXPECTED</code> output, your
solution will be considered correct (even though OK will report a test
failure).</p>


<h3 id="data">Data</h3>


<p>A block of 10 store locations, numbered 1 through 10, already has some cafes.
Cafes can serve espresso, bagels, coffee, muffins, and eggs (but nothing else).</p>

<pre><code>-- Locations of each cafe
create table cafes as
  select "nefeli" as name, 2 as location union
  select "brewed"        , 8             union
  select "hummingbird"   , 6;

-- Menu items at each cafe
create table menus as
  select "nefeli" as cafe, "espresso" as item union
  select "nefeli"        , "bagels"           union
  select "brewed"        , "coffee"           union
  select "brewed"        , "bagels"           union
  select "brewed"        , "muffins"          union
  select "hummingbird"   , "muffins"          union
  select "hummingbird"   , "eggs";

-- All locations on the block
create table locations as
  with locations(n) as (
    select 1 union
    select n+1 from locations where n &lt; 10
  )
  select * from locations;</code></pre>

<h3 class="question" id="q1">Question 1</h3>

<p>You would like to open a new cafe. Create a table <code>open_locations</code> that
has a single column <code>n</code> where each row is a location that is not already
occupied by an existing cafe.</p>

<pre><code>-- Locations without a cafe
create table open_locations as
<span class="sol-highlight">  select n from locations, cafes group by n having min(abs(n-location)) &gt; 0;</span>

-- select * from open_locations where n &gt;= 5;
-- Expected output:
--   5
--   7
--   9
--   10</code></pre>

<p><em>Hint</em>: Join <code>locations</code> and <code>cafes</code> in the <code>from</code> clause, so that you can
compare a location <code>n</code> with the <code>location</code> of an existing cafe.</p>

<p><em>Hint</em>: A location is open if its minimum distance from an existing cafe is
more than 0. The built-in <code>abs</code> and <code>min</code> functions can be used to express
this condition in a <code>having</code> clause.</p>

<p>You can test your solution interactively using <code>sqlite3</code> by comparing with the expected output above.</p>

<pre><code>$ sqlite3 -init quiz04.sql
sqlite3&gt; select * from open_locations where n &gt;= 5;</code></pre>

<p>You can also test your solution using <code>ok</code>:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q open</code></pre>

<h3 class="question" id="q2">Question 2</h3>

<p>To limit competition, the block mandates that no cafe can have a menu item
that is sold by another cafe within 2 locations. So, if location 2 already
sells bagels, then a cafe located at 1, 3, or 4 cannot sell bagels. You may
assume that every item is sold by at least one cafe.</p>

<p>Create a table <code>allowed</code> that has two columns, a location <code>n</code> and a menu
<code>item</code>. The rows should contain every item that can be sold at every
location, based on these constraints. It should include occupied
locations that could expand their current menus.</p>

<pre><code>-- Items that could be placed on a menu at an open location
create table allowed as
  with item_locations(item, location) as (
    select item, location from cafes, menus where name = cafe
  )
<span class="sol-highlight">  select n, item from locations, item_locations
      group by n, item having min(abs(n-location)) &gt; 2;</span>

-- select * from allowed where n &gt;= 5;
-- Expected output:
--   5|bagels
--   5|coffee
--   5|espresso
--   6|espresso
--   7|espresso
--   8|espresso
--   9|eggs
--   9|espresso
--   10|eggs
--   10|espresso</code></pre>

<p><em>Hint</em>: Join <code>locations</code> and <code>item_locations</code>, so that you can compare how
far a location <code>n</code> is from the <code>location</code> at which an item is already sold.</p>

<p><em>Hint</em>: Group by a combination of the location <code>n</code> and the <code>item</code> that might
be sold at <code>n</code>; use a <code>having</code> clause to filter the groups.</p>

<p><em>Hint</em>: You <strong>do not</strong> need to use <code>open_locations</code> from the previous question.</p>

<p>You can test your solution interactively using <code>sqlite3</code> by comparing with the expected output above.</p>

<pre><code>$ sqlite3 -init quiz04.sql
sqlite3&gt; select * from allowed where n &gt;= 5;</code></pre>

<p>You can also test your solution using <code>ok</code>:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q allowed</code></pre>

<h3 class="question" id="q3">Question 3: Challenge Problem (optional)</h3>

<p><strong>This question is optional and ungraded. It is strongly recommended for
practice! You will need to answer the previous two questions successfully to
answer this question.</strong></p>

<p>You decide you will sell as many menu items as possible in your new location.
Create a table <code>full</code> that has three columns, an open location <code>n</code>, a
comma-separated list of <code>items</code> that you would sell, and the length of that
list. The <code>items</code> should be in alphabetical order, and only the longest
possible list of <code>items</code> for each <code>location</code> should appear as a row.</p>

<pre><code>-- Open locations and their maximum-length menus
create table full as
<span class="sol-highlight">  with open_allowed(n, item) as (
    select a.n, a.item from allowed as a, open_locations as b where a.n = b.n
  ),
  options(location, items, last, k) as (
    select n, item, item, 1 from open_allowed union
    select n, items || ", " || item, item, k+1 from allowed, options
      where item &gt; last and n = location
  )
  select location as n, items, max(k) from options group by location;</span>

-- select n, items from full where n &gt;= 5;
-- Expected output:
--   5|bagels, coffee, espresso
--   7|espresso
--   9|eggs, espresso
--   10|eggs, espresso</code></pre>

<p>You can test your solution interactively using <code>sqlite3</code> by comparing with the expected output above.</p>

<pre><code>$ sqlite3 -init quiz04.sql
sqlite3&gt; select n, items from full where n &gt;= 5;</code></pre>

<p>You can also test your solution using <code>ok</code>:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q full</code></pre>
