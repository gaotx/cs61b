<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>


<p>In this project, you will develop a simulator and multiple strategies
for the dice game Hog. You will need to use <em>control statements</em> and
<em>higher-order functions</em> together, as described in Sections 1.2
through 1.6 of <a href="http://composingprograms.com">Composing Programs</a>.</p>

<p>In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to reach 100 points first.
On each turn, the current player chooses some number of dice to roll,
up to 10. That player's score for the turn is the sum of the dice
outcomes, unless any of the dice comes up a 1, in which case the score
for the turn is only 1 point (the <strong>Pig out</strong> rule).</p>

<p>To spice up the game, we will play with some special rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Free bacon</strong>. A player who chooses to roll zero dice scores one more
  than the largest digit in the opponent's score.</p>

  <p><em>Examples:</em> if Player 1 has 42 points, Player 0 gains 1 + max(4, 2) = 5
  points by rolling zero dice.  If Player 1 has 48 points, Player 0
  gains 1 + max(4, 8) = 9 points.</p></li>
  <li><strong>Hog wild</strong>. If the sum of both players' total scores is a multiple
  of seven (e.g., 14, 21, 35), then the current player rolls four-sided
  dice instead of the usual six-sided dice.</li>
  <li><p><strong>Hogtimus prime</strong>. If at the end of a turn the sum of the scores of both
  players is a prime number, then the points earned during the current turn are
  also added to the score of the current leader at the end of the turn. If
  after adding the boost, the total score happens to be another prime number,
  subsequent boosts are not applied. In addition, if the two scores are equal,
  <em>no boost is applied to either score</em>.</p>

  <p><em>Example 1</em> Player 0 has 5 points and Player 1 has 20; it is Player 0's
  turn. Player 0 scores 4 more points, bringing the total number of points
  to 29. The current leader is Player 1, who has more than Player 0's 9
  points, so 4 points are added to Player 1's score. Player 0 now has 9
  points, and Player 1 has 24.</p>

  <p><em>Example 2:</em> Player 0 has 34 points and Player 1 has 29; it is Player 1's
  turn. Player 1 scores 8 more points, bringing the total number of points
  to 71. The current leader is Player 1 with 37 points, so 8 more points
  are added to Player 1's score. Player 0 now has 34 points, and Player 1
  has 45 points.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This project includes five files and two directories, but all of your
changes will be made to the first file, and it is the only one you
should need to read and understand. To get started, <strong>download</strong> all of
the project code as a <a href="hog.zip">zip archive</a>.</p>

<h2 id="logistics">Logistics</h2>


<p>This is a one-week project. You may work with one other partner.  You
should not share your code with students who are not your partner.</p>

<p>Start early! The amount of time it takes to complete a project (or any
program) is unpredictable.</p>

<p>You are not alone! Ask for help early and often — the TAs, readers,
lab assistants, and your fellow students are here to help. Try
attending office hours or posting on Piazza.</p>

<p>In the end, you will submit one project for both partners. The project
is worth 20 points. 18 points are assigned for correctness, and 2
points for the overall <a href="/composition">composition</a> of your
program.</p>

<p>The only file that you will submit is <code>hog.py</code>. You do not need to modify or
turn in any other files to complete the project. To submit the project, change
to your <code>hog</code> directory (with <code>hog.py</code> and <code>ok</code>) and run <code>python3 ok --submit</code>.
You will be able to view your submissions on the
<a href="http://ok.cs61a.org">ok dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>For the functions that we ask you to complete, there may be some
initial code that we provide. If you would rather not use that code,
feel free to delete it and start from scratch. You may also add new
function definitions as you see fit.</p>

<p>However, please do <strong>not</strong> modify any other functions.  Doing so may
result in your code failing our autograder tests. Also, please do not
change any function signatures (names, argument order, or number of
arguments).</p>


<h2 id="graphical-user-interface">Graphical User Interface</h2>


<p>A <strong>graphical user interface</strong> (GUI, for short) is provided for you.
At the moment, it doesn't work because you haven't implemented the
game logic.  Once you complete the <code>play</code> function, you will be able
to play a fully interactive version of Hog!</p>

<p>In order to render the graphics, make sure you have Tkinter, Python's
main graphics library, installed on your computer. Once you've done
that, you can run the GUI from your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py</code></pre>

<p>Once you complete the project, you can play against the final strategy
that you've created!</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py -f</code></pre>


<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>


<p>Throughout this project, you should be testing the correctness of your
code.  It is good practice to test often, so that it is easy to isolate
any problems.</p>

<p>We have provided an <strong>autograder</strong> called <code>ok</code> to help you with
testing your code and tracking your progress. The first time you run
the autograder, you will be asked to <strong>log in with your @berkeley.edu
account using your web browser</strong>. Please do so. Each time you run
<code>ok</code>, it will back up your work and progress on our servers.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of <code>ok</code> is to test your implementations, but there
is a catch. At first, the test cases are <em>locked</em>. To unlock tests,
run the following command from your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -u</code></pre>

<p>This command will start an interactive prompt that looks like:</p>

<pre><code>=====================================================================
Assignment: Project 1: Hog
OK, version v1.3.7
=====================================================================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unlocking tests

At each "? ", type what you would expect the output to be.
Type exit() to quit

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 0 &gt; Suite 1 &gt; Case 1
(cases remaining: 1)

&gt;&gt;&gt; test_dice = make_test_dice(4, 1, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; test_dice()
?</code></pre>

<p>At the <code>?</code>, you can type what you expect the output to be. If you are
correct, then this test case will be available the next time you run
the autograder.</p>

<p>The idea is to understand <em>conceptually</em> what your program should do
first, before you start writing any code.</p>

<p>Once you have unlocked some tests and written some code, you can check
the correctness of your program using the tests that you have unlocked:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok</code></pre>

<p>To help with debugging, <code>ok</code> can also be run in interactive mode:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -i</code></pre>

<p>If an error occurs, the autograder will start an interactive Python
session in the environment used for the test, so that you can explore
the state of the environment.</p>

<p>Most of the time, you will want to focus on a particular question.
Use the <code>-q</code> option as directed in the problems below.</p>

<p>The <code>tests</code> folder is used to store autograder tests, so make sure
<strong>not to modify it</strong>. You may lose all your unlocking progress if you
do. If you need to get a fresh copy, you can download the <a href="hog.zip">zip
archive</a> and copy it over, but you will need to start
unlocking from scratch.</p>


<h2 id="phase-1-simulator">Phase 1: Simulator</h2>


<p>In the first phase, you will develop a simulator for the game of Hog.</p>


<h3 id="problem-0-0-pt">Problem 0 (0 pt)</h3>


<p>The <code>dice.py</code> file represents dice using non-pure zero-argument
functions. These functions are non-pure because they may have
different return values each time they are called. The documentation
of <code>dice.py</code> describes the two different types of dice used in the
project:</p>

<pre><code>- Dice can be fair, meaning that they produce each possible
  outcome with equal probability. Examples: four_sided, six_sided.

- For testing functions that use dice, deterministic test dice
  always cycle through a fixed sequence of values that are passed
  as arguments to the make_test_dice function.</code></pre>

<p>Before we start writing any code, let's understand the <code>make_test_dice</code>
function by unlocking its tests.</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q q00 -u</code></pre>

<p>This should display a prompt that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>=====================================================================
Assignment: Project 1: Hog
OK, version v1.3.7
=====================================================================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unlocking tests

At each "? ", type what you would expect the output to be.
Type exit() to quit

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 0 &gt; Suite 1 &gt; Case 1
(cases remaining: 1)

&gt;&gt;&gt; test_dice = make_test_dice(4, 1, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; test_dice()
?</code></pre>

<p>You should type in what you expect the output to be. To do so, you
need to first figure out what <code>test_dice</code> will do, based on the
description above.</p>

<p>Once you successfully unlock all cases for this question, you can
verify that the test dice work correctly by checking the tests:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q q00</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> you can exit the unlocker by typing <code>exit()</code> (without
quotes). <strong>Typing Ctrl-C on Windows to exit out of the unlocker has
been known to cause problems, so avoid doing so.</strong></p>


<h3 id="problem-1-2-pt">Problem 1 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>roll_dice</code> function in <code>hog.py</code>. It takes two
arguments: the number of dice to roll and a <code>dice</code> function. It
returns the number of points scored by rolling that number of dice
simultaneously: either the sum of the outcomes or 1 (pig out).</p>

<p>To obtain a single outcome of a dice roll, call <code>dice()</code>. You must
call the <code>dice</code> function <em>exactly</em> the number of times specified by
the first argument (even if a 1 is rolled) since we are rolling all
dice simultaneously in the game.</p>

<p>To test the correctness of your implementation, first unlock the tests
for this problem:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q q01 -u</code></pre>

<p>And then check that the tests pass:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q q01</code></pre>

<p>Remember that you can start an interactive Python session if an error
occurs by adding a <code>-i</code> option to the end:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q q01 -i</code></pre>

<p>The <code>roll_dice</code> function has a <a href="http://composingprograms.com/pages/14-designing-functions.html#default-argument-values">default argument value</a>
for <code>dice</code> that is a random six-sided dice function. The tests use fixed dice.</p>


<h3 id="problem-2-1-pt">Problem 2 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>take_turn</code> function, which returns the number of points
scored for a turn.  You will need to implement the <em>Free bacon</em> rule.
You can assume that <code>opponent_score</code> is less than 100. For a score
less than 10, assume that the first of two digits is 0. Your
implementation should call <code>roll_dice</code>.</p>

<p>Test your implementation before moving on:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q q02 -u
python3 ok -q q02</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-3-1-pt">Problem 3 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>select_dice</code> function, which helps enforce the <em>Hog
wild</em> special rule. This function takes two arguments: the scores for
the current and opposing players. It returns either <code>four_sided</code> or
<code>six_sided</code> dice that will be used during the turn.</p>

<p>Test your implementation before moving on:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q q03 -u
python3 ok -q q03</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-4-1-pt">Problem 4 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>To help you implement the <em>Hogtimus prime</em> special rule, we've written
an <code>is_prime</code> function. The <code>is_prime</code> function should return <code>True</code>
if the number is prime and <code>False</code> if it is not.</p>

<p>However, there are mistakes in the implementation provided! Your job
is to correct the errors. You can change the function however you
wish, but the structure provided is a good place to start. You may
find this <a href="http://albertwu.org/cs61a/notes/debugging">debugging guide</a>
helpful.</p>

<p>Test and debug the given implementation before moving on:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q q04 -u
python3 ok -q q04</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-5-3-pt">Problem 5 (3 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>play</code> function, which simulates a full game of
Hog. Players alternate turns, each using the strategy originally
supplied, until one of the players reaches the <code>goal</code> score. When the
game ends, <code>play</code> returns the final total scores of both players, with
Player 0's score first, and Player 1's score second.</p>

<p>Here are some hints:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remember to enforce all the special rules! You should enforce the
  <em>Hog wild</em> special rule here (by calling <code>select_dice</code>), as well as
  the <em>Hogtimus Prime</em> special rule here.</li>
  <li>You should use the <code>take_turn</code> function that you've already written.</li>
  <li>You can get the value of the other player (either 0 or 1) by calling
  the provided function <code>other</code>.</li>
  <li>A <em>strategy</em> is a function that determines how many dice a player
  wants to roll, depending on the scores of both players. A strategy
  function (such as <code>strategy0</code> and <code>strategy1</code>) takes two arguments:
  scores for the current player and opposing player. A strategy
  function returns the number of dice that the current player wants to
  roll in the turn. Don't worry about details of implementing
  strategies yet. You will develop them in Phase 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>Test your implementation before moving on:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q q05 -u
python3 ok -q q05</code></pre>

<p>Once you are finished, you will be able to play a graphical version of
the game. We have provided a file called <code>hog_gui.py</code> that
you can run from the terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py</code></pre>

<p>If you don't already have Tkinter (Python's graphics library)
installed, you'll need to install it first before you can run the GUI.</p>

<p>The GUI relies on your implementation, so if you have any bugs in your
code, they will be reflected in the GUI. This means you can also use
the GUI as a debugging tool; however, it's better to run the tests
first.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You have finished Phase 1 of this project!</p>


<h2 id="phase-2-strategies">Phase 2: Strategies</h2>


<p>In the second phase, you will experiment with ways to improve upon the
basic strategy of always rolling a fixed number of dice. First, you need to
develop some tools to evaluate strategies.</p>


<h3 id="problem-6-2-pt">Problem 6 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>make_averaged</code> function, which is a higher-order function that
takes a function <code>fn</code> as an argument. It returns another function that takes
the same number of arguments as <code>fn</code> (the function originally passed into
<code>make_averaged</code>). This returned function differs from the input function in that
it returns the average value of repeatedly calling <code>fn</code> on the same arguments.
This function should call <code>fn</code> a total of <code>num_samples</code> times and return the
average of the results.</p>

<p>To implement this function, you need a new piece of Python syntax! You
must write a function that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments,
then calls another function using exactly those arguments. Here's how
it works.</p>

<p>Instead of listing formal parameters for a function, we write <code>*args</code>.
To call another function using exactly those arguments, we call it
again with <code>*args</code>. For example,</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def printed(fn):
...     def print_and_return(*args):
...         result = fn(*args)
...         print('Result:', result)
...         return result
...     return print_and_return
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_pow = printed(pow)
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_pow(2, 8)
Result: 256
256</code></pre>

<p>Read the docstring for <code>make_averaged</code> carefully to understand how it
is meant to work.</p>

<p>Test your implementation before moving on:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q q06 -u
python3 ok -q q06</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-7-2-pt">Problem 7 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>max_scoring_num_rolls</code> function, which runs an
experiment to determine the number of rolls (from 1 to 10) that gives
the maximum average score for a turn.  Your implementation should use
<code>make_averaged</code> and <code>roll_dice</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If two numbers of rolls are tied for the maximum average
score, return the lower number. For example, if both 3 and 6 achieve a
maximum average score, return 3.</p>

<p>Test your implementation before moving on:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q q07 -u
python3 ok -q q07</code></pre>

<p>To run this experiment on randomized dice, call <code>run_experiments</code> using
the <code>-r</code> option:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog.py -r</code></pre>

<p><strong>Running experiments</strong> For the remainder of this project,
you can change the implementation of <code>run_experiments</code> as you wish.
By calling <code>average_win_rate</code>, you can evaluate various Hog
strategies. For example, change the first <code>if False:</code> to <code>if
True:</code> in order to evaluate <code>always_roll(8)</code> against the
baseline strategy of <code>always_roll(5)</code>.  You should find that it loses
more often than it wins, giving a win rate below 0.5.</p>

<p>Some of the experiments may take up to a minute to run. You can always reduce
the number of samples in <code>make_averaged</code> to speed up experiments.</p>


<h3 id="problem-8-1-pt">Problem 8 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>A strategy can take advantage of the <em>Free bacon</em> rule by rolling 0
when it is most beneficial to do so.  Implement <code>bacon_strategy</code>, which
returns 0 whenever rolling 0 would give <strong>at least</strong> <code>margin</code> points
and returns <code>num_rolls</code> otherwise.</p>

<p>Test your implementation before moving on:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q q08 -u
python3 ok -q q08</code></pre>

<p>Once you have implemented this strategy, change <code>run_experiments</code>
to evaluate your new strategy against the baseline. You should find that it
wins more than half of the time.</p>


<h3 id="problem-9-2-pt">Problem 9 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>A strategy can also take advantage of the <em>Hogtimus prime</em> rule. The
<code>prime_strategy</code></p>

<ol>
  <li>Rolls 0 if it would cause a beneficial boost that gains points.</li>
  <li>Rolls <code>num_rolls</code> if rolling 0 would give a boost to the opponent.</li>
  <li>If rolling 0 does not cause either score to be boosted, then do so
  if it would give <strong>at least</strong> <code>margin</code> points and roll <code>num_rolls</code>
  otherwise.</li>
</ol>

<p>Test your implementation before moving on:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -q q09 -u
python3 ok -q q09</code></pre>

<p>Once you have implemented this strategy, update <code>run_experiments</code> to
evaluate your new strategy against the baseline.  You should find that
it performs even better than <code>bacon_strategy</code>, on average.</p>

<p>At this point, run the entire autograder to see if there are any tests
that don't pass.</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-10-3-pt">Problem 10 (3 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement <code>final_strategy</code>, which combines these ideas and any other
ideas you have to achieve a win rate of at least 0.56 (for full credit)
against the baseline <code>always_roll(5)</code> strategy.  (At the very least,
try to achieve a win rate above 0.54 for partial credit.) Some ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You only need 100 points to win. If you are near the goal, try not
  to pig out and give your opponent a chance to win.</li>
  <li>If you are in the lead, you might take fewer risks. If you are
  losing, you might take bigger risks to catch up.</li>
  <li>Vary your rolls based on whether you will be rolling four-sided or
  six-sided dice.</li>
  <li>Find a way to leave your opponent with four-sided dice more often.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may want to increase the number of samples to improve the approximation of
your win rate. After submitting your project to ok, you can also check your
exact average win rate (without sampling error) on the submission page.</p>

<p>You can also play against your final strategy with the graphical user
interface:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py -f</code></pre>

<p>The GUI will alternate which player is controlled by you.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you have reached the end of your first CS 61A project!</p>
